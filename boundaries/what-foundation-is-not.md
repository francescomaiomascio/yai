# What the ICE Foundation Is Not

This document explicitly defines what the **ICE Foundation is not**.

Its purpose is to prevent ambiguity, scope creep, and false authority by stating,
without exception, which responsibilities and concerns are **excluded by design**
from the Foundation layer.

If a concept appears in this list, it **does not belong** in the ICE Foundation,
regardless of how important or central it may seem to the overall ecosystem.

---

## The Foundation Is Not an Execution System

The ICE Foundation does NOT:

- Execute actions or workflows
- Manage lifecycles or state transitions
- Schedule, orchestrate, or coordinate processes
- Handle failures, retries, or recovery
- Interact with external systems at runtime

Execution belongs to **Runtime** and **Engine** domains.

---

## The Foundation Is Not an Intelligence System

The ICE Foundation does NOT:

- Perform inference, reasoning, or planning
- Learn from data or past behavior
- Adapt dynamically to context
- Optimize decisions or outcomes
- Contain models, prompts, or embeddings

Intelligence belongs to **AI** and **Consciousness** domains.

---

## The Foundation Is Not a Memory or Knowledge System

The ICE Foundation does NOT:

- Store long-term or short-term memory
- Maintain knowledge graphs or embeddings
- Preserve historical context or decision logs
- Perform retrospective or causal analysis
- Accumulate experience over time

Memory and continuity belong to **Consciousness**.

---

## The Foundation Is Not an Observability or Monitoring System

The ICE Foundation does NOT:

- Collect logs, metrics, or traces
- Provide dashboards or visualizations
- Implement telemetry pipelines
- Define alerting or monitoring rules
- Measure performance or health

Visibility belongs to **Observability**.

---

## The Foundation Is Not an Integration Layer

The ICE Foundation does NOT:

- Define APIs or protocols
- Integrate with providers or services
- Manage credentials or external access
- Handle data ingestion or export
- Act as middleware or glue code

Integration belongs to **Protocols** and **Providers**.

---

## The Foundation Is Not a Tooling or UX Layer

The ICE Foundation does NOT:

- Provide CLI tools or developer utilities
- Define user interfaces or dashboards
- Expose configuration systems
- Optimize developer experience
- Offer interactive workflows

Tooling and UX belong to downstream projects.

---

## The Foundation Is Not a Policy or Governance Process

The ICE Foundation does NOT:

- Define organizational policies
- Encode business rules
- Manage human approval workflows
- Replace legal, ethical, or social governance
- Act as an operational authority

The Foundation defines **constraints**, not **processes**.

---

## What the Foundation Actually Is

By exclusion, the ICE Foundation is:

- A **conceptual authority**
- A source of **axioms** and **structural invariants**
- A definition of **what is valid**, not how it is done
- A permanent constraint layer for all ICE systems
- A boundary that all other domains must respect

The Foundation defines **truth conditions**, not behavior.

---

## Canonical Status

This document is authoritative.

Any attempt to introduce excluded concerns into the ICE Foundation
constitutes a structural violation of the ICE architecture.

The Foundation must remain **small**, **stable**, and **conceptually pure**.

Everything else belongs elsewhere.

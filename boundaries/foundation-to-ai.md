# Boundary: Foundation ↔ AI / Intelligence

## Purpose

Define and formalize the **conceptual boundary** between the **ICE Foundation**
and the **AI / Intelligence** domain.

This document establishes that **inference, reasoning, learning, and adaptation**
do not possess foundational authority and must never redefine axioms,
structural invariants, or conceptual validity.

The goal is to prevent **capability** from collapsing into **authority**.

---

## Foundational Position

The ICE Foundation is **pre-intelligent** and **non-inferential**.

It defines:

- Axioms that establish what is assumed to be true
- Structural invariants that constrain authority, traceability, and determinism
- Conditions under which actions may be authorized and executed
- The separation between **inference** and **control**

The Foundation does **not** reason.

The Foundation does **not** infer.

---

## Role of the Foundation

The ICE Foundation:

- Defines **validity conditions** for action and meaning
- Establishes **authority boundaries** intelligence may not cross
- Constrains how inference results may be interpreted
- Guarantees that no decision becomes self-authorizing

The Foundation defines **what is allowed to happen**,  
not **what should be inferred**.

---

## Role of AI / Intelligence

AI / Intelligence:

- Performs inference, reasoning, pattern extraction, and learning
- Produces hypotheses, intent, proposals, and recommendations
- Operates strictly under explicit authority constraints
- Never executes actions autonomously
- Never grants itself authority

AI answers **what might be done**,  
never **what is permitted to occur**.

---

## Explicit Non-Responsibilities of the Foundation

The ICE Foundation does **NOT** define, imply, or govern:

- Model architectures or training strategies
- Inference algorithms or techniques
- Learning, adaptation, or fine-tuning logic
- Planning, prompting, or optimization methods
- Intelligence accuracy, performance, or capability metrics
- Model selection or evaluation criteria

All such concerns belong **exclusively** to the AI / Intelligence domain.

---

## Constraint Relationship

The relationship is asymmetric:

- The Foundation constrains **authority, validity, and effect**
- AI produces **intent**, not execution
- All AI output must be mediated by explicit authority
- No inference result is self-authorizing

If an AI decision bypasses authority, traceability,
or governance constraints, the AI system is invalid —
not the Foundation.

---

## Boundary Violations

The following constitute **boundary violations**:

- Treating inference as authority
- Allowing AI to execute or enforce decisions
- Encoding intelligence behavior as axioms or invariants
- Using AI output to redefine foundational truth
- Allowing learning outcomes to override explicit authority

Such violations invalidate ICE compliance.

---

## Canonical Status

This boundary definition is **canonical and authoritative**.

Any AI or intelligent subsystem claiming ICE compliance
must demonstrate strict separation between:

- inference
- authority
- execution

The Foundation constrains AI impact.  
AI never extends Foundation authority.

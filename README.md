# ICE Runtime
## Execution Substrate of the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Runtime is the **execution substrate** of ICE.

It is where ideas stop being hypothetical
and start being accountable.

ICE Runtime does not decide *what* to do.  
It ensures that **whatever is done is valid**.

---

## Foundation Dependency

This project derives its assumptions, invariants, and boundaries from  
**ICE Foundation v1.0.0**.

ICE Foundation defines what is allowed.  
ICE Runtime enforces that allowance under execution pressure.

If execution violates the Foundation,
the Runtime is wrong — not the axioms.

---

## Role in the ICE Ecosystem

ICE Runtime occupies a fixed position:

**Foundation → Runtime → Engine → Intelligence → Interfaces**

ICE Runtime:

- does not infer intent
- does not optimize meaning
- does not reinterpret authority

It exists to make execution:

- explicit
- constrained
- inspectable
- accountable

---

## What ICE Runtime Is

ICE Runtime is:

- an **execution substrate**
- a **lifecycle governor**
- an **event and state coordinator**
- an **authority-enforcing layer**
- the **ground truth of execution**

If it ran, it was authorized.  
If it changed state, it is traceable.

---

## What ICE Runtime Is Not

ICE Runtime is **not**:

- an AI system
- an agent framework
- a business logic layer
- an orchestration UI
- a scripting engine
- a policy language

Execution is not intelligence.
ICE keeps them separate on purpose.

---

## Core Responsibilities

ICE Runtime is responsible for:

- enforcing execution lifecycles
- supervising long-running processes
- managing sessions and workspaces
- routing and validating events
- governing state transitions
- enforcing authority boundaries
- preserving traceability and accountability
- exposing execution-level observability

ICE Runtime does not guess.
It enforces.

---

## Governance

ICE Runtime operates under strict governance:

- execution is authority-bound
- invalid assumptions cause suspension
- reconfiguration cannot self-authorize
- nothing runs silently
- nothing escapes responsibility

Governance is inherited.
It is not configurable.

---

## Usage Model

ICE Runtime is not built for demos.

It is embedded by:

- ICE Engine
- agent systems
- automation layers
- developer tools (e.g. ICE Studio)

If you want convenience, use a framework.  
If you want control, you use a runtime.

---

## Canonical Status

ICE Runtime is a **constrained executor**.

If Runtime behavior contradicts ICE Foundation,
the Runtime is incorrect by definition.

---

## Notes

Execution systems rot fast.

ICE Runtime is designed to resist that,
even when it makes development slower.

Speed without control is just latency to failure.

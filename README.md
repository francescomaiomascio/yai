# YAI  
### YAI Ain’t Intelligence

YAI is not “just another AI project”.

It is a **layered sovereign runtime system** designed to make cognition,
execution and authority explicit, enforceable, and auditable.

YAI separates probabilistic intelligence from deterministic control.
It treats governance as a first-class architectural primitive.

---

## Vision

Most AI systems blur boundaries between inference, execution, and authority.

YAI does the opposite.

It builds a **machine-level runtime** where:

- authority is explicit
- effects are gated
- workspaces are isolated
- memory is structured
- execution is deterministic where it must be

YAI is not an app.  
It is an operating surface for governed cognition.

---

## Architecture Overview

YAI is stratified into clearly defined layers:

### `law/` — L0  
Axioms, invariants, protocol definitions, formal models (TLA+).  
The canonical source of truth.

### `kernel/` — L1  
Low-level authority and enforcement runtime (C).  
Session guards, transport, boundary enforcement.

### `engine/` — L2  
Deterministic execution bridge and gated runtime services (C).  
Storage, network, provider gates, execution cortex.

### `mind/` — L3  
Control plane and cognition layer (Rust).  
Graph memory, providers, reasoning orchestration, CLI surfaces.

### `boot/`  
Canonical entrypoint and root control plane.  
One machine, multiple workspaces.

### `scripts/` — Certification & Gates  
Deterministic verification suites and operational gates.

## Core Principles

- **Single Runtime per Machine**
- **Multiple Isolated Workspaces**
- **Strict Protocol Contracts**
- **Authority Before Execution**
- **Deterministic Commit Surfaces**
- **Probabilistic Compute Contained**

YAI enforces boundaries instead of assuming discipline.

---

## Current Status

- Root Control Plane introduced
- Workspace kernel isolated
- Strict RPC envelope enforced
- Handshake and authority gating active
- Multi-workspace runtime in progress

This repository is under active architectural consolidation.

---

## Who This Is For

YAI is for engineers who:

- care about formal guarantees
- want deterministic boundaries around AI systems
- believe governance should be implemented, not described

If you are here, you are entering a system that takes architecture seriously.

It is the structure that makes intelligence accountable.

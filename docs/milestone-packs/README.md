# Milestone Packs

Milestone Packs (MP) package delivery outcomes with explicit traceability and evidence.

They are not generic notes.
An MP is a closure artifact for a concrete phase and should make review/audit straightforward.

## What an MP should state

- what changed,
- which phase/runbook it belongs to,
- which repos are impacted,
- compatibility classification,
- proof/evidence pointers.

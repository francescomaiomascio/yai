# Proposals

Proposals are pre-decision documents.
They are used when we need structured exploration before freezing an ADR.

## Use proposals when

- multiple options exist,
- risk/tradeoff analysis is still open,
- constraints are not yet fully pinned,
- decision quality benefits from explicit alternatives.

## Template

- `docs/templates/proposals/PRP-000-template.md`

## Relationship with ADRs

- Proposal: exploration and option analysis.
- ADR: final decision and consequences.

Accepted proposals should be linked from the resulting ADR for historical traceability.

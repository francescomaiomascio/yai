# Runbooks

Runbooks translate decisions into phased, repeatable execution.

A good runbook must be deterministic:
- clear preconditions,
- explicit procedure,
- verifiable outcomes,
- rollback/failure handling.

## Typical runbooks in this repo

- `docs/runbooks/root-hardening.md`
- `docs/runbooks/workspaces-lifecycle.md`
- `docs/runbooks/engine-attach.md`

## Template

- `docs/templates/runbooks/RB-000-template.md`

## Traceability expectation

Runbooks should link:
- upstream ADRs and law/spec anchors,
- downstream milestone packs as phases are delivered.

## Description of the Issue

Describe the problem **factually and precisely**.

- What is unclear, inconsistent, or invalid?
- Where does the contradiction or ambiguity arise?
- Why does this matter at the system level?

Avoid opinions. Avoid proposals at this stage.

## Axiomatic or Invariant Context

Explain how this issue relates to existing axioms or invariants.

- Which assumption is challenged?
- Which invariant is at risk?
- What would break if this remains unresolved?
